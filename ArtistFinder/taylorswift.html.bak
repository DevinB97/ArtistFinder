                Taylor Swift is an American singer-songwriter known for her narrative songwriting that often centers on her personal life, love stories, and emotional experiences. She was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania, and began her career in country music before transitioning to pop and exploring other genres.

                Swift released her self-titled debut album in 2006 which included hits like "Tim McGraw."
